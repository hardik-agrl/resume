<h3>Diabetic Retinopathy using Deep Learning</h3>
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning
techniques were used to develop and train a deep learning model
for diabetic retinopathy detection. Achieved high accuracy in
classifying retinal images as normal or showing signs of diabetic
retinopathy, potentially improving diabetic patients' early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

<h3>Image Denoising Using Autoencoders</h3>
It removes the noise in an image using convolutional neural networks and autoencoders. Used MNIST datasets. Normalize the
input, add noise to prepare the input dataset and prepared the model using convolution and filters.

<h3>Speech Recognition using Matlab</h3>
Build a speech recognition system using matlab which will take the
speech of users as input and will display which word was spoken
using correlation.
