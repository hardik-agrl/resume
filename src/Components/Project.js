          <h3>Diabetic Retinopathy using Deep Learning</h3>
          Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques
          were used to develop and train a deep learning model for diabetic
          retinopathy detection. Achieved high accuracy in classifying retinal
          images as normal or showing signs of diabetic retinopathy, potentially
          improving diabetic patients' early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

          <h3>Image Denoising Using Autoencoders</h3>
          It removes the noise in an image using convolutional neural networks
          and autoencoders. Used MNIST datasets. Normalize the input, add noise
          to prepare the input dataset and prepared the model using convolution
          and filters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Speech Recognition using Matlab</h3>
          Build a speech recognition system using matlab which will take the
          speech of users as input and will display which word was spoken using
          correlation.
